This project required me, in a team, to use Puppet and Puppet Enterprise to construct an entirely automated system for installing and configuring a continuous integration pipeline. The team managed the project by utilising the SCRUM framework, using Git for version control, and using JIRA to monitor progress. By using vagrant, I set up a number of servers that would automatically communicate with a puppet master and carry out puppet runs at scheduled intervals. The generation and signing of the certificates by the master was all fully automated. 

I was tasked with creating an environment that would launch Jenkins, Jira, Nexus, Zabbix and UrbanCode-Deploy using Docker. By using the Dockerfile convention, I created containers that would deploy each tool as specified. Through the use of docker compose I was able to deploy all the containers at once. I also used docker swarm to manage the containers.

<h2><b> removing images and containers </b></h2>
<b>containers </b>
Kill containers and remove them:

	docker rm $(docker kill $(docker ps -aq))

<b>images</b>

	#removes a specific image
	docker rmi the_image     
	
However, if you need to remove multiple you could use:
Remove all images

 	docker rmi $(docker images -qf "dangling=true")
 	docker rmi $(docker images -q)

You could use grep to remove all except my-image and ubuntu

  	docker rmi $(docker images | grep -v 'ubuntu\|my-image' | awk {'print $3'})
  	
Note: Replace kill with stop for graceful shutdown
